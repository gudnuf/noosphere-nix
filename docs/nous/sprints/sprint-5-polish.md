# Sprint 5: Polish & Ship

**Duration:** ~2 weeks
**Status:** Not started
**Depends on:** Sprint 4

## Goal

Make nous production-ready. Beautiful, smooth, packaged, and documented. Ready for daily use.

## What We'll Achieve

- Animations and transitions (Framer Motion)
- Theme system (dark/light/custom)
- Settings UI for all configuration
- Command palette fully functional
- Native notifications
- Error handling and recovery
- Nix flake packaging
- Home Manager module
- User documentation

## Key Questions to Answer

- What animations add value vs feel gimmicky?
- How do we handle first-run onboarding?
- What settings need UI vs config file only?
- How do we distribute updates?

## Milestone

**"I use nous every day and it feels polished and reliable."**
